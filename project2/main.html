                            In 507, the legendary Geatish warrior Beowulf travels to Denmark with his band of soldiers
                            including his best friend Wiglaf to help King Hrothgar, who needs a hero to slay Grendel, a
                            hideously malformed troll-like creature with appalling strength and cunning who attacked and
                            killed many of Hrothgar's warriors during a celebration in the mead hall Heorot. Upon
                            arriving, Beowulf becomes attracted to Hrothgar's wife Queen Wealtheow.

                            Beowulf and his men celebrate in Heorot to lure Grendel out. When the beast attacks, Beowulf
                            decides to have an even fight and engages him unarmed and naked. During the fight, Beowulf
                            discovers that Grendel has hypersensitive hearing and ruptures the creature's eardrum.
                            Grendel shrinks in size and manages to escape only after Beowulf severs his arm, mortally
                            wounding him. In thanks for freeing his kingdom from the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his
                            golden drinking horn, which commemorates Hrothgar's victory over the mighty dragon Fafnir.

                            In his cave, Grendel's mother swears revenge over his corpse. She travels to Heorot and
                            slaughters Beowulf's men in the night. Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf that Grendel's
                            mother is the last of the Demons. Hrothgar's adviser, Unferth, offers Beowulf his sword
                            Hrunting to slay Grendel's mother. Beowulf and Wiglaf then travel to the demon's cave, where
                            Beowulf enters alone and encounters the demon, who takes the form of a beautiful,
                            gold-covered naked woman. He tries to kill her with Hrunting but fails due to her magic;
                            instead, she seduces him with promises to make him king in exchange for the drinking horn
                            and a son to replace Grendel, which Beowulf agrees to when they both kiss.
